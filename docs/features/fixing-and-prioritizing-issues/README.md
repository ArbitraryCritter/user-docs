# Fixing and prioritizing issues

After you use Snyk to scan your code for vulnerabilities and license compliance issues, you can then decide how to prioritize then fix these issues.&#x20;

### Deciding priorities

Snyk provides a wide range of functions to help you fix and prioritize issues identified, helping you to decide which issues to work on first:

* The [snyk-priority-score.md](starting-to-fix-vulnerabilities/snyk-priority-score.md "mention") prioritizes issues based on a number of industry-standard criteria.
* Snyk provides [reporting.md](../../introducing-snyk/snyks-core-concepts/reporting.md "mention") to help you prioritize issues, and allows you to [ignore-issues.md](issue-management/ignore-issues.md "mention").
* You can use [security-policies](security-policies/ "mention") to automatically prioritize or de-prioritize specific vulnerabilities.

### Fixing issues

After you decide issue priority, you can then get to work [starting-to-fix-vulnerabilities](starting-to-fix-vulnerabilities/ "mention").

Snyk can provide fix advice and generate automatic PRs for upgrades. See [remediate-your-vulnerabilities.md](issue-management/remediate-your-vulnerabilities.md "mention").
