# Using the Snyk Vulnerability Database

Snykâ€™s security team maintains the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io), to ensure the database maintains high accuracy and eliminates false positives.

This work includes curating vulnerabilities found or reported elsewhere on the web, as well as doing our own research to uncover previously unknown vulnerabilities, which we then responsibly disclose. Snyk Enterprise gets early notifications for issues our research uncovers alongside this responsible disclosure process.

* All items in the database are analyzed and verified.
* The team also invests in proprietary research to discover new vulnerabilities. See the Snyk [disclosed vulnerability list](https://app.snyk.io/disclosed-vulnerabilities).

### Vulnerability sources

Most of the vulnerabilities in our database originate from one of these sources:

1. _Monitoring other vulnerability databases_, such as CVEs from [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov) and many others.
2. _Monitoring user activity on GitHub_, including issues, PRs and commit messages that may indicate a vulnerability.
3. _Bulk research_, using tools that look for repeated security mistakes across open source package code
4. _Manual research_, investing our researchers time to manually audit more widely used packages for security flaws.

For every issue deemed to be a real vulnerability, we assign the correct CVSS (severity) score and package version specification, create an advisory, and make this issue available to Snyk products for your use.
