# Other tools

Snyk makes certain tools available to users that address specific pain points that may not be addressed by the product mainlines. In these instances, the tool's documentation is provided in this section.

Have an idea for a tool? Checkout [Snyk Apps](../integrations/snyk-apps/), Apps provide an opportunity to mold your Snyk experience to suit your specific needs. Or, contact [Snyk Support with questions](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/).

You will need an existing [Snyk Account](https://snyk.io/login?cta=sign-up\&loc=nav\&page=support\_docs\_page) with populated projects to use the tools in this section.
