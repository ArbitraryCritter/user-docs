# Other tools

Snyk provides tools to help with specific pain points that may not be addressed by the main Snyk product lines. Documentation for these tools is provided in this section.

Have an idea for a tool? Checkout [Snyk Apps](../integrations/snyk-apps/), which provides an opportunity to mold your Snyk experience to suit your specific needs. You can also contact [Snyk Support with questions](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/).

You will need an existing [Snyk Account](https://snyk.io/login?cta=sign-up\&loc=nav\&page=support\_docs\_page) with populated projects to use these tools.
