# Step 4: Setting up the Code Agent

The setup of the Code Agent consists of two steps:

1\.  Downloading or updating the Docker image of the Code Agent (see below).\
**Note:** It is highly recommended to pull and use the latest Docker image version. &#x20;

2\.  [Running the Code Agent container based on the downloaded Docker image](./#4.2-running-the-code-agent-container). \
**Note**: If you are using a proxy server, see also [Setting up the Code Agent to work with a Proxy Server](./#setting-up-the-code-agent-to-work-with-a-proxy-server). &#x20;
