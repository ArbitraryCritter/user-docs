# Troubleshooting Snyk Reports

## Access

If reporting is not loading in the Snyk UI, the following troubleshooting steps may help resolve the issue.

**Note:** Whitelisting may be necessary due to some firewall settings. If whitelisting snyk.io was required for the initial implementation, additional whitelisting may be necessary for new reporting access. Contact your account team for more information.

If you still have issues accessing the new reporting after using these troubleshooting tips, [submit a ticket](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Snyk support.

## Snyk Code

While other Snyk products have a more robust look-back period, historical data for Snyk Code issues will be available as of early November 2022.&#x20;

## Data freshness

Data is available in reporting \~1 hour after a scan occurs.

## Known limitations

Exporting to PDF currently includes 10 results in table views. Expect improvements to this over time.

## Filtered views

It is possible that the way filtered views are managed in the URL will change over time. In the event that happens, you can generate a new filtered URL in the UI to be bookmarked or shared.&#x20;
