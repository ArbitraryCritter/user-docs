## Edit a policy

1. Click on the policy name of an existing policy in the Policy Manager tab to open the modal and then make your changes
2. Adjust [organizations](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360007590198), [attributes](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360018220857) and/or rules as desired
3. Once you've made your changes in the Policy modal, make sure to click **Submit** in the top right hand corner to save your changes

## **Other Actions:**

Clicking on the **...** on the right-hand side of the policies table will provide a drop down that allows you to delete a policy.

Deleting a policy cannot be undone. If you delete a policy that has organizations assigned to it, those organizations will return to the [default policy](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360007476397).

Duplicating a policy will copy over the rules of a policy, but not the assigned organizations or attributes. The new policy will automatically be called ‘Copy of \(Policy Name\)…” and can be edited.
