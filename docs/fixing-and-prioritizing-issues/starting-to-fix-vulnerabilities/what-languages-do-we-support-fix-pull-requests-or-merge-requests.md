# What languages do we support Fix Pull Requests or Merge Requests?

When integrations are created within Snyk where the user has read and write permissions from respective integrations, Snyk can provide Fix PRs or MRs for dependencies that may have a patch or an upgrade which would fix a vulnerability.

Snyk currently supports the ability to create Fix Pull Requests \(Fix PRs\) or Merge Requests \(MRs\) via [Integration](integrations) in the following package managers:

* [NPM](snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-javascript)
* [Yarn](snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-javascript)
* [Ruby](snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-ruby)
* [Maven](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003817357-Snyk-for-Java-Gradle-Maven-)
* [Python](snyk-open-source/language-and-package-manager-support/snyk-for-python)
