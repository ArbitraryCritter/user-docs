# Snyk Vulnerability Database

## Introduction

The [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/) contains the key security information used by Snyk products to find and fix code vulnerabilities.

### Access to the Database

You can inspect the database at [https://security.snyk.io/](https://security.snyk.io/), or you can incorporate database information into your own systems.

Incorporating information into your own systems may be useful for customers who already have their own security products; you can benefit from Snykâ€™s expertise and accumulated knowledge with access to this database. This gives your development teams access to trusted intelligence, allowing them to rapidly secure open source and container code.

#### Feeds

The Snyk Vulnerability Database includes two feeds:

* [Application security](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/) vulnerabilities: supporting Snyk Open Source, with manually-curated content and summaries, including code snippets where applicable.
* Linux OS vulnerabilities, supporting Snyk Container.

Both feed options can be licensed directly.

#### Incorporating the Vulnerability Database into your systems

You can incorporate Snyk Vulnerability Database information in your system. Typically:

1. Snyk helps you to set an integration up for your company, providing documentation with instructions for access.
2. Snyk sends you database information, typically as a JSON file (see [sample code](https://snyk.io/partners/api/v4/vulndb/sample.json)) **Note**: It is recommends that you save the file in a database.
3. You can now write code to use the database information in your systems.
