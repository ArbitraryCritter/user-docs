Snyk reports show the status of all of your projects, issues, dependencies, and licenses, for your organization or group. See [Snyk Reports](../../../fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/snyk-reports/) for full details on Snyk reporting functions.

### Dependency reports

Snyk reporting acts as a Bill of Materials (BOM) to quickly and easily identify which projects have a specific version of a dependency. Dependency reports identify each individual open source dependency by name, along with version, vulnerabilities, and related projects.

See [Dependencies tab](../../../fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/snyk-reports/dependencies-tab.md).

### License reports

The Licenses area displays all licenses that are currently used in your project, and allows you to understand which project and dependency use a license.

See [Licenses tab](https://docs.snyk.io/reports-1/reports/licenses-tab).
