# Maximum number of projects in an organization

Depending on the type of plan you have with Snyk you will have a limit on the number of projects you can import into a single organization.

| Plan       | Number of Projects |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Free       | 10,000             |
| Team       | 25,000             |
| Business   | 25,000             |
| Enterprise | 25,000             |
| Pro        | 25,000             |
| Standard   | 25,000             |

### How you will know when you have reached the limit?

When you reach the limit, Snyk will stop importing more projects into the organization. 

You will know you have hit this limit when you see this banner in the Snyk UI:

![A banner will display at the top of the Project page telling you how many projects you have over the limit](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png>)

This limit is in place to protect your experience of Snyk. There are no restrictions on the number of organizations you can create. If you are getting close to these limits, you can create more organizations  and split your projects across them.
