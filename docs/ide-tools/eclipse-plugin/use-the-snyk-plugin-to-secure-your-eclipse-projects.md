## Use the Snyk plugin to secure your Eclipse projects

Once the language server is downloaded and the authentication is done, the plugin will successfully start the workspace scan. You might notice a confirmation that a workspace scan is starting. Snyk shows such a notification when there is no workspace scan available.

All of the issues found by Snyk are now natively integrated with Eclipse's flows. Issues are shown in the Problems tab (see the following screenshot). There is a squiggly line indicating the issue while you code plus the gutter icons to indicate where the issue is.
