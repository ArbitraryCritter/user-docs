# Snyk CI/CD Integration

When you decide to use a CI/CD Integration, typically you will adopt the integration in stages. You will select a deployment method and implement strategies for the code you are scanning. See S[nyk CI/CD Integration deployment and strategies](snyk-ci-cd-integration-deployment-and-strategies/).
