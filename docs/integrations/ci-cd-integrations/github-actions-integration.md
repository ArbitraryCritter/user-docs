# GitHub Actions integration

Snyk offers a set of [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-actions) for using Snyk, to check for vulnerabilities in your GitHub projects,  that are based on the [Snyk CLI](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003812578-CLI-reference).  

[See the Snyk Actions repository for installation and usage instructions](https://github.com/snyk/actions)
