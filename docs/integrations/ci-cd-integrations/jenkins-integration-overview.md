# Jenkins integration

Snyk offers a native plugin for Jenkins that is based on the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/guides-for-our-cli/cli-reference), to test and monitor projects for vulnerabilities in your pipelines.

For full documentation, [visit the Snyk Jenkins Plugin repository](https://github.com/jenkinsci/snyk-security-scanner-plugin).
