# TeamCity integration

Integrate the Snyk Security plugin with the JetBrains continuous integration (CI) tool, TeamCity, to embed open source vulnerability scanning directly into your automated build chain. The TeamCity integration adds an additional build step to scan for vulnerabilities in your project as part of your build. After the scan you can push your project to Snyk for continuous monitoring.

The Snyk plugin scans as part of your build and then displays test results directly from the TeamCity UI. This enables you to track, identify, and fix issues that risk the security of your application more quickly and over time as fixes are made available for vulnerabilities or new vulnerabilities are disclosed.
