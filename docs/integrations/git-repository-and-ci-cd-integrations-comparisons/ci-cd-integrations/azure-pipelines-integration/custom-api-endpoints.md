# Custom API endpoints

By default, the task uses the [https://snyk.io/api](https://snyk.io/api) endpoint. It is possible to configure Snyk to use a different endpoint by setting a `SNYK_API` environment variable in the pipeline:

Refer to [Configuration to connect to the Snyk API](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli#configuration-to-connect-to-the-snyk-api) in the CLI docs for more information about environment configuration.
