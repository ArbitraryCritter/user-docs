### Snyk products and environments

Select a Snyk product to match your scanning requirements; open source libraries, your own application code, or configuration and container information.

Select an environment (a way to run Snyk) based on your requirements: the browser-based Web UI, a Command-Line Interface (CLI), using an API, or embedded in your own IDE.

See [snyk-products-and-environments.md](snyk-products-and-environments.md "mention") for more details.

### Supported languages and integrations

Snyk supports a wide range of languages to allow you to scan your code in the languages you use, and integrations to use Snyk with leading IDE, repository, CI/CD, runtime, registry, and issue management tools.
