# Introducing Snyk

Snyk is a platform allowing you to scan, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in [your own code](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/), [Open Source dependencies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-open-source), [Container images](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container), and [Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/).

### Snykâ€™s developer-first approach

Developers now assemble applications with a combination of proprietary and open source code, run that code in containers, and then deploy with infrastructure as code configurations with technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform.&#x20;

A good security process secures each of these components where they are built and maintained. Snyk integrates into DevOps processes to work the with developers in the methods they prefer to work while following and supporting industry best practices. Snyk integrates directly into your IDEs, workflows, and automation pipelines to add security expertise to your toolkit.

#### Using Snyk in your workflow

* **Secure your code**: use [Snyk Open Source](../products/snyk-open-source/) to fix open source vulnerabilities and [Snyk Code](../products/snyk-code/) to fix vulnerabilities in application codebases.
* **Secure your environments**: use [Snyk Container](../products/snyk-container/) to fix vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes workloads and [Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](../products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/) to fix misconfigurations in Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and Azure templates.

### Ways to run Snyk

Snyk runs in the browser as [Snyk Web UI](../snyk-web-ui/), in the command line with the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli) (Command Line Interface), in various [IDE plugins](../ide-tools/) that embed Snyk in your local dev environment, and with the [Snyk API](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/categories/360000665657-Snyk-API) (Application Programming Interface).

See [snyk-products-and-environments.md](snyk-products-and-environments.md "mention") for more details.

### Supported languages and integrations

Snyk supports a [wide range of languages and integrations](snyk-languages-and-integrations.md) to use Snyk with leading IDE, repository, CI/CD, runtime, registry, and issue management tools.

See [snyk-languages-and-integrations.md](snyk-languages-and-integrations.md "mention") for more details.

### **What does it cost?**

Snyk has several [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) available:

* **Free**: For individual developers and small teams looking to secure while they build. Limited tests.
* **Team**: For dev teams looking to build security into their development process with shared visibility into projects. Unlimited tests.
* **Business**: Empower developers across an organization and provide reporting and advanced controls to manage teams and control to shift security left. Unlimited tests.
* **Enterprise**: Standardize dev-first security across the enterprise, with centralized policy governance. Unlimited tests.
