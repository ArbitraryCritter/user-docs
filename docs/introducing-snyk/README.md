# Introducing Snyk

Snyk tests for vulnerabilities in [your own code](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/), [open source dependencies](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-open-source), [Container images](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-container), and [Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/), and offers context, prioritization, and fixes.

### Snyk overview

Snyk is an application security platform that integrates into DevOps processes to work the way developers like to work.

Developers now assemble applications via a combination of proprietary and open source code, run code in containers, and deploy and configure via infrastructure as code technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform. A cloud native application security process needs to be able to secure each of these components in an integrated and efficient manner.

### Snyk products and environments

Select a Snyk product to match your scanning requirements; open source libraries, your own application code, or configuration and container information.

Select an environment (a way to run Snyk) based on your requirements: the browser-based Web UI, a Command-Line Interface (CLI), using an API, or embedded in your own IDE.

See [snyk-products-and-environments.md](snyk-products-and-environments.md "mention") for more details.

### Supported languages and integrations

Snyk supports a wide range of languages to allow you to scan your code in the languages you use, and integrations to use Snyk with leading IDE, repository, CI/CD, runtime, registry, and issue management tools.

See [snyk-languages-and-integrations.md](snyk-languages-and-integrations.md "mention") for more details.
