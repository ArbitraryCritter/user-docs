Snyk Project information appears in the **Projects** menu in the Snyk dashboard. The filters that are visible depends on the grouping option you choose.

### Projects

Snyk Projects define the manifest files that Snyk scans for issues, with configuration information defining how to run that scan.

### Targets

Projects are held in a Target, which is an external resource that Snyk has scanned, such as a code repository.
