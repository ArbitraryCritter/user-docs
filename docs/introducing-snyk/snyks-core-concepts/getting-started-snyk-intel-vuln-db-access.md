# Snyk Vulnerability Database

## Introduction

The [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/) contains the key security information used by Snyk products to find and fix code vulnerabilities.

Customers who already have their own products can benefit from Snykâ€™s expertise and accumulated knowledge with access to this database. This gives your development teams access to trusted intelligence, allowing them to rapidly secure open source and container code.

## Process overview

1. Snyk helps you to set an integration up for your company.
2. Snyk provides documentation with instructions for access.
3. Snyk sends you database information, typically as a JSON file (see [sample code](https://snyk.io/partners/api/v4/vulndb/sample.json)) **Note**: It is recommends that you save the file in a database.
4. You write code to use the database information in your systems.

## About the Snyk Vulnerability Database

A team of security experts and analysts manages the Snyk Vulnerability database to ensure the database maintains high accuracy and eliminates false positives.

* All items in the database are analyzed and verified.
* The team also invests in proprietary research to discover new vulnerabilities. See the Snyk [disclosed vulnerability list](https://app.snyk.io/disclosed-vulnerabilities).

## Database feeds

The Snyk Vulnerability Database includes two feeds:

* [Application security](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/) vulnerabilities: supporting Snyk Open Source, with manually-curated content and summaries, including code snippets where applicable.
* Linux OS vulnerabilities, supporting Snyk Container.

Both feed options can be licensed directly.
