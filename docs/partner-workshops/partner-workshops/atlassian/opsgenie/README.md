Use Opsgenie’s Snyk Integration to forward Snyk issues to Opsgenie whenever it finds any licensing or vulnerability issues. Opsgenie determines the right people to notify based on on-call schedules– notifies via email, text messages \(SMS\), phone calls, iOS & Android push notifications, and escalates alerts until the alert is acknowledged or closed.
