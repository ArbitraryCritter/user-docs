# Deployment Options

You can deploy Snyk Code in several ways:

* SaaS - Snyk Code's native SCM integration only allows to access source code available in _cloud-based_ git providers such as GitHub, Gitlab and BitBucket.&#x20;
* SaaS with Local git server - For customers with internet-disconnected SCM environments
* Local Engine - For customers with a more strict policy, requires more maintenance and receives updates slower than the SaaS option, but doesn't require any code upload
