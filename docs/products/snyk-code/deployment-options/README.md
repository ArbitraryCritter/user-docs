# Deployment Options

You can deploy Snyk Code in several ways:

* SaaS - Get the most out of Snyk Code with a native SCM integration, easy onboarding and continuous updates. \
  See [getting-started-with-snyk-code](../getting-started-with-snyk-code/ "mention").
* SaaS with a self-hosted git server (requires Snyk Broker) - For customers with internet-disconnected SCM environments, who want to connect Snyk Code with their local SCM. \
  See [snyk-broker-code-agent.md](../../../features/integrations/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-code-agent.md "mention").
* Local no-upload implementation - For customers with a more strict policy, requires more maintenance and receives slower updates than the SaaS options, but does not require any code upload. See [snyk-code-local-engine](snyk-code-local-engine/ "mention")
