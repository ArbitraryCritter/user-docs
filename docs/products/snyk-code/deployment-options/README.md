# Deployment Options

You can deploy Snyk Code in several ways:

* SaaS - Get the most out of Snyk Code with a native SCM integration, easy onboarding and continuous updates.
* [SaaS with a self-hosted git server](snyk-code-local-git-support.md) (Requires Snyk Broker) - For customers with internet-disconnected SCM environments, who want to connect Code with their local SCM.
* [Snyk Code Local Engine](snyk-code-local-engine/) - For customers with a more strict policy, requires more maintenance and receives slower updates than the SaaS options, but doesn't require any code upload.
