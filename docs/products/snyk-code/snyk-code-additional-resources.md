### **Snyk Code Webinars**

* **Introduction to Snyk Code (Developer-first SAST):** (1:00:57)

Conventional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are limited by lengthy scan times and poor accuracy – returning too many false positives. Sound familiar? That's why Snyk developed a new approach to finding and fixing code vulnerabilities with a developer-friendly experience – introducing: Snyk Code! Watch this live demo of Snyk Code to see how it integrates into Snyk's Cloud Native Application Security platform to help developers build software securely across the entire stack – including the code, open source, containers, Kubernetes, and IaC.

* **Snyk Code Hands-on Workshop:** (57:20)

Snyk Code is developer-first: embedding SAST as part of the development process, enabling developers to build software securely during development, and not trying to find and fix problems after the code is compiled. Snyk Code works in the IDEs and SCMs developers use to build and review software, and provides fast, actionable, meaningful results to fix issues in real-time.

* **Find Vulnerabilities in Your Code with Snyk – Tech With Tim:** (19:43)

In this video, I'll be going over security in python projects and packages. Usually, when we are using Python, we pull packages and dependencies from PYPI. However, there are no security checks needed for these uploaded packages or dependencies.
