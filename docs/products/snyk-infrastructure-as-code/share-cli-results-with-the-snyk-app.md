# Share CLI results with the Snyk App

By using the `snyk iac test` command, you are already set up to address known configuration issues.&#x20;

## See results in the Snyk App

To see these in the Snyk App, run the following:

* `snyk iac test myproject --report` , or
* `snyk iac report myproject`

Example:

```
> snyk iac test myproject --report

This sends a snapshot of your current configuration issues to your Snyk dashboard. \
Log in to Snyk App ([https://app.snyk.io](https://app.snyk.io/login)) and go to your organization's project page, to see the specific snapshot of your scanned project.

You can also open the project itself and see the usual individual project view:

## **Ignores**

You can ignore issues using the Snyk App, or by creating a `.snyk` policy file along with your project when scanning. For more information, see [Iac Ignores using the .snyk policy file](snyk-cli-for-infrastructure-as-code/iac-ignores-using-the-.snyk-policy-file.md).

**Note:** issues that are ignored by using the `.snyk` policy file can not be unignored in the Snyk App.

## **Notes**

Using [Custom rules](custom-rules/) and the Share Results functionality together is not currently supported.

Snyk does not share any file contents over the network, only the required metadata for the configuration issues that were just scanned.

For a full CLI commands, see the [CLI Commands help page](../../snyk-cli/commands/).

For additional information see the [CLI reference](../../snyk-cli/cli-reference/).
