# Share CLI results with the Snyk Web UI

### Introduction

You can use the `snyk iac test` command to address known configuration issues in the [Snyk CLI](../../snyk-cli/).

To see these issues displayed in the Snyk Web UI, run the following CLI command:

`snyk iac test myproject --report`&#x20;

### Example

```
> snyk iac test myproject --report

Testing arm-file.tf...


Infrastructure as code issues:
  âœ— VM Agent is not provisioned automatically for Windows [Low Severity] [SNYK-CC-AZURE-667] in Compute
    introduced by resource > azurerm_virtual_machine[my_terraformvm] > os_profile_windows_config > provision_vm_agent


Organization:      my.org
Type:              Terraform
Target file:       arm-file.tf
Project name:      myproject
Open source:       no
Project path:      myproject

Tested arm-file.tf for known issues, found 1 issues

Your test results are available at: https://app.snyk.io/org/my.org/projects under the name myproject
```

This sends a snapshot of your current configuration issues to your Snyk dashboard, to view in the Snyk Web UI.&#x20;

### Viewing snapshots in the Snyk Web UI

Log in to the Snyk Web UI ([https://app.snyk.io](https://app.snyk.io/login)) and go to your organization's project page, to see the specific snapshot of your scanned project.

You can also open the project itself and see the usual individual project view:

### **Ignores**

You can ignore issues using the Snyk Web UI, or by creating a `.snyk` policy file along with your project when scanning. For more information, see [Iac Ignores using the .snyk policy file](snyk-cli-for-infrastructure-as-code/iac-ignores-using-the-.snyk-policy-file.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Issues that are ignored by using the `.snyk` policy file can not be unignored in the Snyk web UI.
{% endhint %}

### **Notes**

Using [Custom rules](custom-rules/) and the Share Results functionality together is not currently supported.

Snyk does not share any file contents over the network, only the required metadata for the configuration issues that were just scanned.
