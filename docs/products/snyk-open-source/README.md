# Snyk Open Source

Snyk Open Source allows you to find and fix vulnerabilities in the open source libraries used by your applications. It also allows you to find and address licensing issues in (or caused by) these open source libraries.

Snyk Open Source is available on many common languages and platforms. See [language-and-package-manager-support](language-and-package-manager-support/ "mention").

You can use Snyk Open Source in the Snyk Web app, with the Snyk CLI, in your IDE, or with an API. See [getting-started-snyk-open-source.md](getting-started-snyk-open-source.md "mention").

### Find and fix vulnerabilities&#x20;

Snyk provides actionable fix advice for vulnerabilities, and supports workflows to fix vulnerabilities using Pull Requests (PRs); see [fixing-vulnerabilities.md](open-source-basics/fixing-vulnerabilities.md "mention").&#x20;

Snyk Open Source also helps prioritize and report on the vulnerabilities discovered; see [fixing-and-prioritizing-issues](../../features/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/ "mention").
