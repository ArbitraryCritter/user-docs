# Snyk Web UI

No matter how you use Snyk, the **Snyk Web UI** is where you can connect your source code management (SCM) repositories, container registries, and applications. If you haven't already, go to the [Snyk Web UI](https://app.snyk.io/login) and create an account!

After you connect, you can import your repositories and projects so that Snyk can scan, monitor, and fix vulnerabilities in your source code.

## Logging in to Snyk

If your company uses single sign-on (SSO), use the SSO link provided by your administrators.

If your company requires an invitation to use Snyk, you may see a list of [organizations](./#snyk-organizations) when you log in for the first time. This means that you have not yet been invited. Select an Adminsâ€™ name to send an email to request access to that organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you log in with a different authentication provider than the one your company uses for the Snyk account, you create a new account: you won't be logged into the correct organization for your company.
{% endhint %}

### [Snyk organizations](https://docs.snyk.io/introducing-snyk/snyks-core-concepts/groups-organizations-and-users#snyk-organizations)

Organizations in Snyk control access to projects. The organization settings and policies also influence your scan results, depending on which organization you use when you add a project.

Snyk shows your [preferred (or default) organization](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-web-ui/getting-started-with-the-snyk-web-ui#manage-account-preferences-and-settings) when you log into the Snyk Web UI. Snyk also uses the settings for your preferred organization when you test a project locally using the CLI.
