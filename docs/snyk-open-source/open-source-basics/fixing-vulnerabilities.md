# Fixing vulnerabilities

Snyk provides actionable remediation advice to fix vulnerabilities. For more details, see [Remediate your vulnerabilities](https://docs.snyk.io/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/issue-management/remediate-your-vulnerabilities).

Snyk supports workflows to fix vulnerabilities using:

* Automatic pull / merge requests \(PRs / MRs\).
* Manual pull / merge requests.

### Manual pull / merge requests for a project code

To generate a PR / MR directly from your project, using the Snyk UI:

1. Navigate to your project from the project list.
2. Select the file. ![image22.png](https://support.snyk.io/hc/article_attachments/360016090017/image22.png)
