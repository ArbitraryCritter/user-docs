# Example 1

One of these vulnerabilities is with the [`st`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/st) [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package. This is a module for serving static pages. The issue here is that our sample application is using `st@0.2.4` and this has a [directory traversal](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206) vulnerability.

This package is used in our application to serve the about page. If you click on the about page you will notice in the address bar that you are taken to `/public/about.html`.

A potential attacker that discovers a resource that is static may attempt to escape by typing `../` to escape the present context and see what else may be available. Fortunately, if done through the web browser this is normalized and the command will not reach the server. However, we can bypass this using the command line. Let's walk through a couple of examples that illustrate how you can accomplish this. From the terminal, we will use `curl` to perform a few steps. If we attempt to browse using `../` we will fail because `st` will inspect for this and block attempts to list contents using this method.

```bash
curl $GOOF_HOST/public/../../../
```

ï¿½However, there is a vulnerability in `st` and that is that if we use the URL encoded version of `../`, or `%2e`, then are be able to browse the directories.

```bash
curl $GOOF_HOST/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/
```

Let's take a look at this example which demonstrates how this vulnerability would work to escape out and browse the files in `/etc` as well as some file contents.

In this example, we see how a bad actor could exploit this vulnerability and gain access to sensitive information such as the contents of `passwd` and further compromise your security.
