## Audit logs

Snyk offers an endpoint enabling you to [access your audit logs via the API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/). You can query data about user actions, such as when a:

* user logged in and out
* user's role was changed
* license policy was modified and by whom
* service account was created or deleted.

You can query user-initiated activity from up to the past 90 days. If you need to query further back in time, contact our [Customer Support team](mailto:support@snyk.io) who can access this data from cold storage on your behalf.

Use this endpoint to help retroactively triage any unexpected activity, to find out whenever a new user is added so you can assist with onboarding, or even to monitor changes in a user's role in order to get early warning of any unusual behavior.
