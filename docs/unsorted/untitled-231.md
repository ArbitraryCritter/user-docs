# Is it possible to have multiple Snyk orgs use the same broker token?

Yes, please log a ticket with our support team so that we can help you with this.

Be sure to include:

* Orgs that you want to share the broker token;
* Which org you want the token taken from \(ie. the token that will be copied across orgs\)

Once the broker token is updated on Snyk, all orgs that share that broker token will now be connected to your broker!
