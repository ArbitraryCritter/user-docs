# Does Snyk have an API?

When you scan a Docker image in Snyk, you can see information for the **Image layer**:

This is the instruction in the image layers which introduces the vulnerability.

This is similar to the **Dockerfile instruction** \(see [What is a Dockerfile Instruction?](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360006726997-What-is-a-Dockerfile-Instruction-)\). If you have a Dockerfile attached to the project, the **Dockerfile instruction** appears instead of the **Image layer**, as the Dockerfile instruction is more accurate.

There is no need to perform any action.
