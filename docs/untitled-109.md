##  Summary tab

The main dashboard of the Reports area displays a birds-eye view of all of the issues \(vulnerabilities and licenses\) found across all of your projects, presenting data for these specific areas:

* Security issues
* License issues
* Your overall project activityâ€”a summary of all of your projects, tests and issues

### Note
