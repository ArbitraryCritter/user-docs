##  How do I change the email that Snyk uses to send me notifications when connected to a Github account?

When an account is created via a Github integration, the Github account's primary email address will be used as your primary email account for Snyk.io as well. This is not configurable directly in Snyk.io account Settings and must be changed in Github.

To change your primary email account, you must:

1. Log into your **Github Account** and navigate to **Account** &gt; **Settings**.
2. Click on the **Emails** link in the navigation side bar.
3. Add your new email address in the **Add Email Address** section, click **Add**.
4. Before you can proceed, you must Validate your email address by clicking on the Validate link that you just received via email from Github.
5. In the **Primary email address** section, you can now select your new email address as the Primary account for Github. Click **Save**.
6. Log out of your Snyk.io account, if applicable.
7. Log back into your Snyk.io account, and the email should have updated to your new Github Primary email account.
