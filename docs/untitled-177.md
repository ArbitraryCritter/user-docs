##  Managing permissions

Click settings ![cog\_icon.png](https://support.snyk.io/hc/article_attachments/4402908592145/cog_icon.png) &gt; **Members** to invite new team members.

1. The Free plan only has administrators.
2. Enterprise plans have administrators and collaborators.

**Feature availability**  
Our free subscription plan allows you to send up to 200 pending invitations every 7 days. If you have already reached that limit and try to invite additional folks to join you, we'll display an error message for you. Don't worry though! You can send more the next week, or whenever some of the currently pending ones have been accepted. See [Pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.

An organization can have multiple administrators. When you create an organization, you will automatically be an administrator on this organization. If you want to downgrade to collaborator, or leave this organization, the organization has to have at least one other administrator.
