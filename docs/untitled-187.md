##  Creating and editing policies

### Create a policy

1. Click from the Policy Manager, and a modal will appear where you can create your policy 
2. Set a policy name and a description to help you quickly identify a policy 

    **Note:** Policies within the same category cannot have the same name.  
   Policies **cannot** be saved without a policy name applied

3. Select whether you’d like to apply your policy to organizations or project attributes 
4. Select the desired [organizations](/hc/en-us/articles/360007590198) or [attributes](/hc/en-us/articles/360018220857)
5. Add rules to the policy. [Click here for information on adding license rules](/hc/en-us/articles/360007590258) or [click here for information on adding security rules](/hc/en-us/articles/360014473957)
6. Once you've added your rules, make sure to click **Submit** in the top right hand corner

### Edit a policy

1. Click on the policy name of an existing policy in the Policy Manager tab to open the modal and then make your changes
2. Adjust [organizations](/hc/en-us/articles/360007590198), [attributes](/hc/en-us/articles/360018220857) and/or rules as desired
3. Once you've made your changes in the Policy modal, make sure to click **Submit** in the top right hand corner to save your changes

### **Other Actions:**

Clicking on the![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7j0CepqMc6Wv3grM8U17uR3IznA-Vammhg15rHgqSxGfe15MxpDtOJyP0qiOaJJylJxxV-r2aU7mVXJDOjNwwf2cKEZl9OdldZ0HkBdvKT2LV5NLGHRKD77VNos49oNxc1Had723)on the right-hand side of the policies table will provide a drop down that allows you to delete a policy. 

Deleting a policy cannot be undone. If you delete a policy that has organizations assigned to it, those organizations will return to the [default policy](/hc/en-us/articles/360007476397).  


Duplicating a policy will copy over the rules of a policy, but not the assigned organizations or attributes. The new policy will automatically be called ‘Copy of \(Policy Name\)…” and can be edited.
