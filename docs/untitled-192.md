**For Enterprise customers:**

Group administrators can access and set license policy rules via **Policies**

There is an auto-imported Snyk default policy. Our default license policy contains the Snyk default license policy, but the rules can be edited to match your preferences. Any new organizations that are created within your group will be automatically added to the default policy. Once the organization is created, you can move it to a different policy if youâ€™d prefer.
