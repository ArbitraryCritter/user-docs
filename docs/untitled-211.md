##  Reporting

Snyk reports show the status of all of your projects, issues, dependencies, and licenses, for your organization or group. For more details, see [Reports](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/sections/360001138198-Reports).

**Feature availability**  
This feature is available with all paid plans. See [Pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.

Snyk reporting acts as a Bill of Materials \(BOM\) to quickly and easily identify which projects have a specific version of a dependency. Dependency reports identify each individual open source dependency by name, along with version, vulnerabilities, and related projects.

See [Dependencies tab](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004002618-Dependencies-tab).

The Licenses area displays all licenses that are currently used in your project, and allows you to understand which project and dependency use a license. 

See [Licenses tab](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004002638-Licenses-tab).
