# Can I use Python 3 instead of Python 2?

Some Python projects may have dependencies that are only valid on Python 3 and Snyk by default, scans with Python 2.

You can change this on both the SCM \(Source Control Management\) and the CLI \(Command Line Interface\) to adjust the version of Python Snyk uses to scan dependencies. You can set the default Python version at either the project or organization level.

See [Snyk for Python](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004699377-Snyk-for-Python#Versions) for details of setting Python versions in Snyk.
