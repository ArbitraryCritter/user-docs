# Security policies: Conditions

A condition is the variable to set a rule on. Condition categories include:

**Exploit maturity**

**CWE**

After you select a condition category, you are prompted to select **Includes** or **Does not include** and the desired condition \(for example: Mature, CWE-1234\). 

You can stack multiple conditions in the same rule using the **AND** function. 

| **Condition Category** | **Condition Variables/Definitions** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Exploit Maturity | Mature, Proof of Concept, No known exploit |
| CWE | Can be any CWE ID |
