# Security policies: What collaborators see

A newly assigned policy, or changes to a policy, apply when the project is retested. This is what project collaborators see when an action is applied to a vulnerability:

| **Action** | **What project collaborators see**  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Customize severity | The new, custom severity, as well as the originally assigned severity |

## **Examples:** 

**Custom and original severity in the CLI**

**Custom and original severity in Project Page UI**

**Custom and original severity in Open Fix PR UI**

**Custom and original severity in Reports**
