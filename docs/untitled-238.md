# Getting started: Security policies

**Feature availability**  
This feature is available with Enterprise plans. See [Pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.

Security policies allow you to set custom rules to automatically prioritize or de-prioritize specific vulnerabilities. 

Group administrators can access and set security policy rules using the [**Policies**](/hc/en-us/articles/360007476397) tab.
