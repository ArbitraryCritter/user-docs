# Security policies: Actions

An action is what you want to happen when the rule is met. Actions include:

**Customize severity** 

| Action | Definitions |
| :--- | :--- |
| Customize severity | Overrides the assigned severity of a vulnerability |

You cannot stack multiple actions in the same rule. To have multiple actions with a rule,  create a new rule with the same conditions, and specify a different action.
