# Set up Snyk Broker

The Broker client is installed and configured as a Docker image. 

You can customize the configuration using the environment variables in the Docker images. For this reason, install separate, multiple instances of the client for different integration types to ensure proper configuration as well as redundancy.

To install, configure and roll out your Broker client and repository integrations:
