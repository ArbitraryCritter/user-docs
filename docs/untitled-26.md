##  How can we whitelist Snyk IP addresses?

Snyk is delivered over a content delivery network \(CDN\) which rotates IP addresses and entire IP ranges on an ongoing basis.  If you must be able to whitelist Snyk IPs for your project, then contact us to discuss our on-premise solution, which might be what you need.

Generally, it is advised to whitelist traffic to \*.snyk.io on 443 \(HTTPS\).
