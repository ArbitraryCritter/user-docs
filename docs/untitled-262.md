## Clojure Projects

Currently, Snyk doesn't have support for Clojure Projects. However, there is a workaround you can use for this using [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). This allows you to generate a maven-style "pom" file for the project which can then be scanned by Snyk.

Please see an example of this being used [here](https://gist.github.com/garethr/6a517651b62cb43ac3c8a0f9c4ab561d).
