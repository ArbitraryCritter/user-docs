##  Custom file Name on Snyk UI

You cannot customize your file names in the Snyk UI for importing. You can only do this only through the CLI as being mentioned [here](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360002118098-How-do-I-specify-a-custom-manifest-file-name-for-snyk-test-). 

Depending upon the package managers for your project we support the following manifest files with their appropriate names as being discussed [here](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360000911957-Language-support).
