##  Is a GitHub webhook required in order for a repo to be automatically scanned by Snyk on Pull and Push requests?

You do not have to create the webhook in GitHub.

The settings can be configured  in the **Default Snyk test for pull requests** section from the URL:  
`https://app.snyk.io/yourorgname/manage/integrations/github`
