## Issue card information

Issue cards appear in the details page for your project - see [View project information](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360011450838-View-project-information).

Issue cards show details for a specific vulnerability or license issue, and actions you can take with it.

The basic details on the issue card includes:

* Vulnerability or license name
* Issue or license type
* Severity 
* Priority score
* The path the vulnerability or license was introduced through
* The file the vulnerability is fixed in
* Exploit maturity
* Reachability

When you expand the issue card for more information, you can see the following information:

This information includes:

* Detailed path information
* Remediation advice
* Overview of the vulnerability
* Any vulnerable functions within the vulnerability

You can apply multiple filters to a project to show a set of issues:

* If they are a vulnerability or a license issue
* With a specific severity 
* Within a range of the priority score 
* Based on whether it has an exploit, and how mature the exploit is
* That are open, or have been patched or ignored 

The issue cards in a project can be sorted based on their priority score or severity.

### Card actions

You can perform the following actions on the issue card:

* [**Ignore the issue**](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003891098-Ignoring-issues-not-prioritized-for-your-project): if you do not need to take an action on an issue, or it does not need to appear on your reports, you can ignore it.
* [**Create a Jira ticket**](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004002458-Jira): if you have the [Jira integration](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004002458-Jira), you can link your issue boards to Snyk and create Jira tickets directly from the project details page to fix vulnerabilities.
* [**Fix the vulnerability**](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360011484018-Fixing-vulnerabilities): if a fix is available for vulnerabilities, you can fix individual vulnerabilities.
* **View more information about the CWE, CVE, and CVSS score**: navigate from the issue card to further information about these scores.
* **View the Snyk vulnerability database:** navigate to the Snyk vulnerability database about a specific vulnerability from its issue card.
