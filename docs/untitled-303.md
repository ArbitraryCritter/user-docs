##  Unauthorized access or Resource does not exist : Dockerhub

**Problem Statement:** Import fails with the error _Unauthorized access or Resource does not exist_ when importing images from Dockerhub

**Resolution:** This is because your image is private on your Dockerhub account. To resolve this make your image public in the settings&gt;Visibility settings section of your repository.
