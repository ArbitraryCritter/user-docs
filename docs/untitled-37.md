##  Are Snyk patches available indefinitely to apply/view through Snyk's website ?

The patches are a part of [Snyk Open Source Vulnerability database](https://github.com/snyk/vulnerabilitydb) so you can check them out before applying them. Therefore, patches are available indefinitely to apply/view through the Snyk website.

For further research, you can refer to Snyk's process for creating patches section in this [article](https://snyk.io/docs/security/)
