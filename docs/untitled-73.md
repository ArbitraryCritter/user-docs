##  Configure integration for Docker Hub

Enable integration between Docker Hub and Snyk, and start managing your vulnerabilities.

1. Navigate to **Integrations**.
2. Click **Docker Hub**.
3. Enter your Docker Hub username and Access Token and then click **Save**:

    _As the access token, you can either use your DockerHub password or a an access token_ [_created_](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/) _in DockerHub. In case 2FA is activated on your account, access token **only** is applicable._

   Snyk tests the connection values and the page reloads, now displaying Docker Hub integration information and the Add your Docker Hub images to Snyk button.

   A confirmation message that the details were saved also appears in green at the top of the screen. In addition, if the connection to Docker Hub failed, a notification appears.
