##  Container security with Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(ECR\): integrate and test

Snyk integrates with Amazon Elastic Container Registry \(ECR\) to enable you to import your projects and monitor your containers for vulnerabilities, as is fully described in our Container vulnerability management documentation. Snyk tests the projects youâ€™ve imported for any known security vulnerabilities found, at a frequency you control.
