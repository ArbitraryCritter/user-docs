##  How efficient is our Vulnerability Database ?

Snyk has a comprehensive Security coverage offering you the best service in the market .

* 40% of the Snyk's [Vulnerability Database](https://snyk.io/product/vulnerability-database/) is proprietary, and it goes beyond: Snykâ€™s database goes far beyond CVE vulnerabilities \(which consist only 60% of the database\) and includes many additional non-CVE vulnerabilities that are derived from several sources.
* We offer the best coverage in the market : 280% better database coverage as compared to other counterparts. Snyk regularly wins head to head comparisons to other vendors and finds many more vulnerabilities not detected by others
* 72% of the vulns in NPM Audit were already found in Snyk's Database : We are the first to know and publish - Snyk exposes many vulnerabilities before they are added to public databases. On Average, Snyk publishes vulnerabilities 92 days sooner than NPM
